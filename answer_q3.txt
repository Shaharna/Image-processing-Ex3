Q3:

The number of levels on the blending pyramid determine how sharp/ smooth the
blend will be at the result image.
As we learned in class, the number of levels will effect the separation at
the lower frequencies and this will cause a better blend at the general features.
Therefore, when we build with small amount if levels,
the result blend will be sharper then blending with more levels.
