Q2:

The image filters determine the gaussian filter size which will affect the
blurring of the image when we calculate it×³s pyramids.
There is a connection between the size of the image and the size of the filter,
so as we calculate the pyramids because the images get smaller, the filter
will affect the image differently. Meaning it's effect will be more significant.
The bigger the size of the filter is the detailed the images are when blending.
